The Morse Code Flashlight is a creative Arduino-based project that combines technology, communication, and fun. It allows you to interact with Morse code using physical buttons and an LED flashlight, making it an engaging way to learn and experiment with Morse code.

## Features
- **Input Morse Code**: Use the tactile buttons to input Morse code by pressing dots (.) and dashes (-).
- **LED Flashlight**: Visualize Morse code by transmitting it as light signals using the built-in LED flashlight.
- **Text Translation**: The project translates your Morse code input into readable text, helping you understand the language of Morse code.
- **LCD Display**: The LCD screen displays both your Morse code input and the translated text, providing immediate feedback.
- **Educational Tool**: It's an excellent educational tool for Morse code enthusiasts, students, and hobbyists interested in electronics and communication.
- **Customizable**: The project is open-source, allowing you to modify and expand its functionality according to your preferences.
